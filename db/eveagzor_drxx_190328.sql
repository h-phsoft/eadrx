This definitely means that there are serious disparities between the types of thinking of males and females in addition to qualitative biological differences between the two sexes. Males and females are different type each; they may be visual, auditory, kinesthetic or olfactory. However, it happens that some people might have more than one distinctive characteristic. Those are the people who are the most difficult to deal with. Everyone of them is a situated knower and has their innate distinctive characteristics that make them a unique entity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These disparities are not only social or cultural; they are cognitive and biological. That is why there are differences which might be sharp between males and females. There are even differences between males themselves and females themselves. They mainly centre round misunderstanding between the two sexes, having different ways of thinking, different behavior &hellip; etc. You must bear in mind, dear reader, that those disparities will result in a kind of diversity which manifests in acquiring knowledge, having different levels of sexual desire and even different sexual practice (<strong><em>situated sex</em></strong>), and reaching the very results in different ways. In other words, each sex has their own way of obtaining the very piece of knowledge, dealing with it, processing it, comprehending it or transferring it.</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL),

This way also indicates the different kinds of interest people have. Some people highly concentrate on their body, others on ideas and some have interest in both; body and ideas, in different proportions.

When this baby reaches the phase of puberty, there would be a possibility for him/her to become sexually abnormal. When the embryo is feminine, there would be a few or no male hormones in it. This means that the sexual organs are feminine and the main brain structure would maintain its feminine characteristics.

We might suffer from stomach-ache or we might mistakenly think that we will be in a state of nausea upon seeing the person we love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other chemical released by our cerebrums when we are in a state of understanding or love is the noradrenalin which is closely associated with the sense of contingency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is one of the neuro-conductors that are responsible for palm sweating, raising blood pressure and heartbeat rate.

In this case, we have to realize that decrease of the serotonin levels is the cause of the state of lack of happiness that we feel; a state that is contrary to love, but this gives an explanation why love is accompanied with happiness and depression alike. Thus, we come to notice the neural, hormonal and psychological contradiction we all have and which indicates that we need phenylethylamine, noradrenalin and serotonin to be happier, more understanding and to be in good terms with those around us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL),

The answer manifests in the low serotonin levels that incapacitate the frontal lobe and the secretion of adrenaline during outrage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we are in a state of love, our minds fall short of realizing the demerits of those we love. The natural abilities that we seek the help of to evaluate others within a social framework paralyze when we look at the person we love. What happens is that such neural circles are not charged; therefore, they stop working. Low serotonin levels give the reason behind the state of blindness that afflicts lovers, but it enhances their relationship since the part of the cerebrum that is responsible for passing judgments was disabled. Researches in this field indicate that low serotonin levels also give an explanation for our premonitions and our sense of insecurity.In a word, we are subject to the paradox of gaining the happiness of love, yet losing sound judgement which we also lose when we get angry or sad.

However, if her demands are not met, she feels that her femininity is insulted and that the other person does not love her.

Historically speaking, the word <em>oxytocin </em>is derived from a Greek word means <em>&quot;quick birth&quot;</em>. It is related to muscle easy contraction at birth time and it stimulates the uncontrollable flow of milk for breastfeeding mothers.

Her partner has to give her a hand when she is in such a situation by spotting the positive points of the coming change or future that resembles what she feels nostalgic for. But, he has to bear in mind that his aid should not appear as a kind of sympathy with that nostalgia. The first step towards acceptance of changes is embodied in the process of preparing her to acknowledge the sentimental losses resulting from the conditions of change.

You should avoid the direct questions of a female when she is provoked. She is in a state of catharsis or discharging negative energy, so do not let her escalate.

The female&#39;s mind is formulated in such a way as to receive which is a starting point to giving. She is extremely concerned about details and she adores gifts whatever their value is. She is so keen on communication and feeling the other&#39;s caring for her.

Be aware of dealing with a female while she is in the regular period. The lower rates of estrogen imply an increase of testosterone. This stimulates extreme aggressiveness, and means having illogical discussions. It arises in her sexual desire, but it causes her depression. Do not argue with her in such a period. She lies on the opposite side to her nature. The male inside her (testosterone) is higher than the female (estrogen).

Such a situation will unconsciously recall the feminine side of the male (tenderness, warmth, love, weakness&hellip;.etc).

Be careful not to request the female to be your mother, sister, girlfriend and beloved. She only has one job, and she will never ever be your mother. She will not respect that male who holds to his mother. You might assume that your love to your mother will complement her love and that she will appreciate it and consider it as a guarantee to her love. This does not work.

When the female is not in harmony with her very nature as a female; i.e., when she does excessive masculine work or when she undergoes sharp decrease of estrogen, she tries to have many biological practices so as to balance her psychological situation. In such a case, the male should not blame her for this tendency. He should bring her back to the field of femininity through sentimental practices and through indulging her in feminine affiliations along with sharing part of her burden. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:13.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">94.

She is not biologically prepared to deal with issues separately. She deals with things collectively not individually.

A female has a tendency towards looking as oppressed. She has an unconscious belief that she will not obtain sympathy unless the others feel she is made unjust and is badly treated. Do not forget this when you deal with her exaggeration of being a victim of the feeling of injustice. However, when she finds nobody to listen to her complaint, she will shrink and launch self &ndash;destructive actions such as self-torment self-impeachment, and making ultimate judgments against herself.

Notice that the female gives constantly, nevertheless, she waits for your giving in order to recharge hers. The biggest mistake a male would commit is when he imagines that he is dealing with a god who gives persistently and silently because this god does not want the giving of others.

She is living in contrast to her identity. No matter how much satisfaction her position brings her; she has nostalgia to be the centre of males&#39; care and love unlike some women who undergo confusions in their sexual identity due to hormonal causes. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:13.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">100.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:13.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Every female is a unique creature from her point of view.

Be careful not to compare her to any female; do not ask her to be a copy of any other model. The most dangerous of all is when you demand her to be a duplicate of an ex-female you have met in your life.</span></span></span></span></p>', NULL, NULL, NULL),

The more you praise her personal characteristics, the more you enhance those attributes. Do not persist on criticizing her negative aspects. Overlook her negative sides by enhancing and occasionally exaggerating her positive sides. This is the key to dealing with the inherent negative aspects of her structure and character.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:13.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">102. Do not raise her jealousy unless she is a masochist. The masochist female is fond of the male who ignores her and insults her femininity through jealousy or betrayal. It is a part of self-torturing mechanism. A non-masochist female is narcissistic and is concerned about her femininity as previously mentioned. However, some phallic women; women experiencing castration complex, occasionally exaggerate their feminine reaction against jealousy or betrayal through excessive verbal violence or excessive hostility under the title of &quot;dignity&quot;. Females commonly feel tranquility with those who afford them reassurance and appreciate their femininity.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:13.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">103. Do not prevent female from crying. She releases her tension by crying. You have to know that the female who has excessive fits of crying is the most feminine. This type is contrary to the masculine female who does not prefer to cry in order not to be accused of weakness. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:13.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">104.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:13.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Sexual interaction is not favorable and inappropriate at her extreme anger or emotion unless she is a masochist. A non-masochist female does not like having sex if she is irritated. Never interrupt her desire through discussing any other issue that necessitates thinking nor blame her for any behavior. Do not insult her femininity because this will instantly bring her desire to a halt.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:13.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">105. The female is constantly in need of those who elevate her feeling of eternal youth and everlasting beauty. Bearing in mind that there is no ugly woman on earth; each woman has her own particular beauty in a specific aspect. The beauty of woman could not be perfect excluding very rare cases, thus, boost her feeling of her own beauty, get her assured and point to her beauty persistently. This will help her put an end to any feeling related to her identity crisis. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL),

All fashions promote the female&rsquo;s tendency to nakedness through the binary opposition of &ldquo;exterior-interior&rdquo;; i.e., disclosing part of the body while concealing another part which incites seduction. This is part of the female&rsquo;s natural choice of clothes; however, this is accompanied with a paradox: the female desires to expose her full or semi nakedness, but she will be uncomfortable if she does not feel her male&rsquo;s jealousy over her. She herself makes it for public in her own way and to whoever she decides. She wants to show it, but not to sell it. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:13.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">107. You should recognize the tremendous care a female allots to her skin. Her skin equals her; it is her identity and the front fa&ccedil;ade. The skin is what body of the female wears. It is not merely a mirror to her emotions. It is the wall that protects her internal depth. Hence, incessant mutual touching is a way of reviving her relation with her body.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:13.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">108. Accusing a female of having an inclination towards deceiving is true and untrue at the same time. She resorts to the technique of maneuver and gets away from the yes/no or either/or techniques. She revolves around her issues, thus, she looks like a deceiver. Beware of being convinced that she is really deceitful. She is mysterious because of her feminine structure. So, try to read what she refuses to declare; behave accordingly. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:13.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">109. Every female; deep in her unconscious, considers herself as symbol of the utmost femininity. Therefore, when she falls in love, she would yearn to embalm her beloved to keep him for herself only. She would surround him and would even wish not to allow him meet or deal with any other female. </span></span></span></span></p>', NULL, NULL, NULL),

(16, 'There should be a differentiation between sexual hypofunction and sexual anomaly. Sexual hypofunction is the inability to attain sexual satisfaction while sexual anomaly is a deviation from the right goal of the sexual act. However, psychology considers that sexual anomaly is no more than acting opposite to one\'s own sexual nature.', 'يجب التمييز بين القصور والشذوذ الجنسي. فالقصور هو عجز عن تحصيل الإشباع الجنسي، أي عدم الشبع الجنسي، أما ما يسمى بـ (الشذوذ) فهو انحراف بالفعل الجنسي عن غايته. ولكن علم النفس يعتبر أن الشذوذ هو أن يمارس المرء ما هو عكس طبيعته الجنسية.'),
